# StudyNotion

## Project Description
**StudyNotion** is a fully functional ed-tech platform that enables users to create, consume, and rate educational content. The platform is built using the MERN stack, which includes **ReactJS**, **NodeJS**, **MongoDB**, and **ExpressJS**.

### Key Features:
- A seamless and interactive learning experience for students, making education more accessible and engaging.
- A platform for instructors to showcase their expertise and connect with learners across the globe.

## Technical Details

### System Architecture
The StudyNotion ed-tech platform consists of three main components:
- **Front End:** Built using ReactJS for dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **Back End:** Built using NodeJS and ExpressJS for scalable server-side applications.
- **Database:** MongoDB is used for flexible and scalable data storage.

### Front-End
The front end is designed using Figma, providing a clean and minimal user interface. It includes:
- **Homepage:** Introduction and links to course list and user details.
- **Course List:** All available courses with descriptions and ratings.
- **Wishlist:** Courses added to a student's wishlist.
- **Cart Checkout:** Page for completing course purchases.
- **Course Content:** Includes videos and related material.
- **User Details:** Account details and edit options for students and instructors.

### Back-End
StudyNotion uses a monolithic architecture, providing features such as:
- User authentication and authorization with OTP verification.
- Course management for instructors.
- Payment integration using Razorpay.
- Cloud-based media management with Cloudinary.
- Markdown formatting for course content.

#### Frameworks, Libraries, and Tools
- **Node.js** and **Express.js** for the back end.
- **MongoDB** for the database.
- **JWT** for authentication.
- **Bcrypt** for password hashing.
- **Mongoose** for MongoDB interaction.

### API Design
The API is designed following the REST architectural style with endpoints for:
- User signup and login.
- Course management (CRUD operations).
- Rating courses.

### Deployment
The deployment process involves:
- Front End: Deployed using Vercel.
- Back End: Hosted on Render or Railway.
- Media Files: Stored on Cloudinary.
- Database: Managed on MongoDB Atlas.

### Future Enhancements
Potential future improvements include:
- Gamification features to increase engagement.
- Personalized learning paths.
- Social learning features for increased interaction.
- Mobile app development for convenient access.
- Machine learning-powered recommendations.
- Virtual reality/augmented reality integration for immersive experiences.

## Conclusion
StudyNotion is designed to provide an immersive learning experience for students while offering instructors a platform to showcase their expertise. The technical architecture supports scalability and reliability, ensuring a smooth user experience. Future enhancements will aim to improve functionality and engagement across the platform.
